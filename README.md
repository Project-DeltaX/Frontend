# Introduction
Every organization, whether big or small, has human resource challenges to overcome. Internships are popular amongst graduate and undergraduate students who need to gain research or valuable work experience. In 99x also many students hire for intern opportunities every year. But there is only a manual system for sorting the interns. It takes more time to sort the interns and maintain the records. So, we decided to build an intern management system. This is designed to assist in strategic planning and will help us to ensure that organization is equipped with the right level of human resources for its future goals. Also, for those busy executives who are always on the go, these systems come with remote access features, which will allow you to manage their intern workforce anytime, always. One of the main features of the Intern management system is maintaining the full record for interns. This will save both time and money for the 99x company.

# Problem in Brief
99x has faced challenges with its manual system for maintaining intern records and filtering CVs. The system is inefficient, prone to errors, and may overlook qualified candidates. With an increase in intern intakes, there is a need for a more streamlined and automated approach to record-keeping and filtering to ensure that the best candidates are selected. Internships provide crucial work experience and on-the-job training for students and recent graduates. However, the manual process of selecting interns at 99x is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to develop an IMS to streamline intern record management and improve the organization's efficiency in selecting interns.

 # Background & Motivations
An internship is an official program offered by organizations to help train and provide work experience to students and recent graduates. Unfortunately, in today’s job market, passing exams with high scores and getting a degree doesn’t offer the much-needed work experience, we will need to succeed in a workspace. Every year 99x give great opportunities for undergraduates in the internship program. By partaking in an internship, we will be able to gain real-life exposure, grow our knowledge and determine if we are in the right career field. Internships not only provide us with first-hand experience in the real working world but also enable us to understand the career trajectory for our desired job title. We can learn how to apply the knowledge we have acquired during an internship to our future workplaces. Most IT undergraduates’ dream workplace is 99x. In 99x there is a procedure to sorting the undergraduates for internship programs. 
But there is a manual system for that in their busy time. In this world of growing technologies everything has been computerized. With large number of works opportunities, the Human workforce has increased. Thus, there is a need of a system which can handle this problem. So, we decided to develop an Intern management system for 99x. This simplifies the task of maintain records and select the interns.


# Aim
Develop a convenient & efficient intern management system to maintain the records and all the details about the intern intakes until they are re-assign as an employee to the company and develop a CV filtering system to filter out all qualified candidates for the evaluation. 

# Objectives
•	Maintain the Records of the date that the interns assign at the 99x 
•	Maintain the achievement of the interns 
•	Maintain the left dates of the interns from 99x 
•	Maintain the Records of the re-assignment dates of the former interns as an employee at 99x 
•	Filtering the CVs of the candidates for the interns as well as employment 
•	Send emails to all the selected candidates for evaluation. 
•	Create and managing the evaluation sheets of the candidates for the marking panel. 
•	Create profiles of selected candidates in the system.

# Scope
This project aims to develop a web application for intern management at 99x, which includes features such as record-keeping, candidate filtering, and evaluation systems. The application will maintain a comprehensive database of resumes and provide a detailed profile for each selected candidate. Technologies such as web development frameworks and database management systems will be utilized. The project's scope aims to provide an efficient and effective system for intern management at 99x, adhering to scientific documentation principles.

# Proposed Solution
Using a web application to manage the intern employees and their progress details. This application will have some main functionalities. Selecting the applicants from the collected CVs and managing the internship progress of all interns are those main functionalities. Initially, with this application, the panel members can upload the CVs and get filtered CVs. After that, they can manage the scores and grades of all interns through the internship period. The company's higher officials can view the progress details of the intern employees with user a friendly dashboard and, they can filter the interns with some needed filtering options.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
